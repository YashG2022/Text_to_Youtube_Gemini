# ðŸŽ¬ text2youtube

## Description

text2youtube uses cutting-edge AI power for YouTube automation, transforming simple text into engaging video content. Designed with YouTube automation and text-to-video technology in mind, this project streamlines the process of video content creation. It employs advanced AI for scenario generation, text-to-speech synthesis, and video compilation, making it an innovative tool in the field of text-to-video and YouTube automation.

## Features

ðŸ“œ Automated video script generation from prompt + reference information (like from another video script). We not only generate the script itself but also queries to Youtube/Storyblocks so that we can compose our video later from a set of clips we download from those queries.

ðŸŽ™ Video voice generation with Bark. Bark is the best for naturally sounding voice at the moment, voice is one of the most important parts of a Youtube video and we did a bunch of experiments there. It runs quick on Google Colab with A100 GPU attached. 

ðŸŽ¨ We have some basic code for stitching videos together with MoviePY but it works real slow, so for now we just export the clips from Storyblocks/Youtube and voice-over and stitch them together in Adobe Premier which takes seconds not minutes.

## Demos

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Install text-to-speech `pip install git+https://github.com/suno-ai/bark.git`
3. Ensure the `cookies.json` file is present with necessary credentials for **storyblocks.com** website access.
4. Ensure `env.yaml` file is present providing OpenAi API key and working directories
5. Provide the necessary OpenAI prompt in prompts directory
6. Provide the necessary content inputs in text files in SOURCE_DIR
7. Run the main application file `app.py` to start the content creation process.
8. The program will handle the rest, creating engaging videos with captivating voiceovers.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules:

- `src.audio`: Contains audio-related functions for text-to-speech synthesis.
- `src.config`: Stores configuration settings for the program.
- `src.logger`: Implements logging functionality for the application.
- `src.openai_generation`: Handles interactions with OpenAI's ChatGPT for scenario generation.
- `src.video_processing`: Manages video downloads from YouTube or videoblocks.com.
- `src.utils`: Contains utility functions for data processing and file handling.
- `src.video`: Includes video-related functions for compilation and editing.

## Results

While developing, we decided to focus on the finance niche and create a youtube channel on Economics/Countries topic. [Here is the channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0JQ0xmoK_lcg5AchMGmI4Q)

We posted 1 video daily for about 20-25 days. In the end, we got around 8,000 views, 221 watch hours, and +70 subscribers, average watch time of the video was around 30%. The results of the experiment are pretty encouraging because the videos are not of very high quality and I expected worse.


## What To Improve
- It's hard to change the quality of naturally sounding voice generation at the moment but I think we can have a big boost in video generation itself. For example, finding a way to make high-quality text overlays on top of video clips would give a big advantage. Or parsing images from google and applying parallax (ken burns effect) on top
- Improving video generation speed with MoviePY, so videos wouldn't have to be exported into adobe premier pro.
- Allow option to create youtube shorts content, though there are plenty projects which already do that.

## Dependencies

- [OpenAI GPT-3 API](https://openai.com): For scenario generation using language models.
- [Neural Network Text-to-Speech Library BARK](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark/): For realistic audio synthesis.
- [Python Requests Library](https://pypi.org/project/requests/): For website access and video downloads.
- [MoviePy Library](https://pypi.org/project/moviepy/): For video compilation and editing.
